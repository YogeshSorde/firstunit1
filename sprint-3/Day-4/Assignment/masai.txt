Myself Yogesh Sorde i have joined Masai to get the Knowledge of coding and to become a web developer 
on the first day i thought that how can i manage the  timings of Masai but later after
some time management i was able to do that. The IA's and the teaching staff always helped me to 
solve my doubts in class , Also due to masai i am eager to learn new things.
